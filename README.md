# GraphBasics

This repository provides basic graph interfaces, example implementations, and common graph algorithms.

This code aims to be instructional and serves as a playground for learning about graphs. It intentionally lacks advanced features and has been simplified for ease of understanding.

The code was written relatively quickly, so some aspects may not have been thoroughly thought out. Interface and implementation stability are not guaranteed, as the code may be rewritten entirely at the author's discretion.

This code should not be used for any serious production project.
